# Search Paths Reference

Complete reference for where the CLI searches for task files and rule files.

## Search Paths Overview

The CLI searches for rules and tasks in directories specified via the `-d` (strict) or `-D` (lenient) flags. The working directory (`-C` or current directory) and home directory (`~`) are **automatically added** as strict search paths, so they don't need to be specified explicitly.

**Lenient search paths** (`-D`): Errors are logged as warnings and problematic files are skipped instead of causing a fatal error. For skills with a missing `name` field, the name is inferred from the directory name. This is useful for third-party or shared directories where you don't control file quality.

All directories (local and remote) are processed via go-getter, which downloads remote directories to temporary locations and processes local directories directly.

### Task File Search Paths

Within each directory, task files are searched in the following locations:

1. `.agents/tasks/`

**Note:** Task files are matched by filename (without `.md` extension), not by `task_name` in frontmatter.

**Namespaced tasks:** Use `namespace/taskname` syntax (e.g., `myteam/fix-bug`) to search `.agents/namespaces/myteam/tasks/` first, falling back to `.agents/tasks/`. See [Namespace Search Paths](#namespace-search-paths) below.

### Command File Search Paths (for slash commands)

Command files are referenced via slash commands inside task content. Within each directory, command files are searched in:

1. `.agents/commands/`
2. `.cursor/commands/`
3. `.opencode/command/`

### Skill File Search Paths

Skill files provide specialized capabilities with progressive disclosure. Within each directory, skill files are searched in:

1. `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.agents/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)
2. `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.cursor/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)
3. `.opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.opencode/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)
4. `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.github/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)
5. `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.claude/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)
6. `.gemini/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.gemini/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)
7. `.augment/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.augment/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)
8. `.windsurf/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.windsurf/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)
9. `.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` (each subdirectory in `.codex/skills/` can contain a `SKILL.md` file)

```

├── data-analysis/
│   └── SKILL.md

### Discovery Rules

- All `.md` files in these directories are examined
- Tasks are matched by filename (without `.md` extension), not by `task_name` in frontmatter
- The `task_name` field in frontmatter is optional and used only for metadata
- If multiple files have the same filename, selectors are used to choose between them
- First match wins (unless selectors create ambiguity)
- Searches stop when a matching task is found
- Directories are searched in the order they appear in `-d` flags, then the automatically-added working directory and home directory

### Example

```
Project structure:
./.agents/tasks/fix-bug.md            (task file, matched by filename "fix-bug")
./.agents/tasks/code-review.md        (task file, matched by filename "code-review")
./.agents/commands/deploy-checks.md   (command file, referenced via slash command in tasks)
~/.agents/tasks/plan-feature.md       (task file in home directory)

Commands:
coding-context fix-bug           → Uses ./.agents/tasks/fix-bug.md (from working directory)
coding-context code-review       → Uses ./.agents/tasks/code-review.md (from working directory)
coding-context plan-feature      → Uses ~/.agents/tasks/plan-feature.md (from home directory)

# Command files are NOT invoked directly, but referenced inside task content via slash commands like:
# /deploy-checks arg1 arg2
```
```

**Note:** The working directory and home directory are automatically added to search paths, so tasks in those locations are found automatically.

## Namespace Search Paths

When a task name contains a `/` (e.g., `myteam/fix-bug`), the part before the slash is treated as a namespace. Namespace paths are always searched **before** their global equivalents so that namespace assets take precedence.

### Namespace Directory Root

```
.agents/namespaces/<namespace>/
├── tasks/
├── rules/
├── commands/
└── skills/
```

### Namespace Path Resolution Order

| Asset | Search order |
|---|---|
| **Tasks** | `.agents/namespaces/<ns>/tasks/` → `.agents/tasks/` |
| **Rules** | `.agents/namespaces/<ns>/rules/` then **all** global rule paths (both layers always included) |
| **Commands** | `.agents/namespaces/<ns>/commands/` → global command paths (first match wins) |
| **Skills** | `.agents/namespaces/<ns>/skills/` + all global skill paths (all included; namespace listed first) |

**Non-namespaced tasks** (e.g., `fix-bug`) use only the standard global paths — no namespace layer is consulted.

Only the generic `.agents/` structure supports namespacing. Agent-specific paths (`.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.github/`, etc.) are unaffected.

### Namespace Example

```
.agents/
├── tasks/
│   └── fix-bug.md              # global task
├── rules/
│   └── company-standards.md   # global rule, always included
└── namespaces/
    └── myteam/
        ├── tasks/
        │   └── build.md        # accessed via "myteam/build"
        ├── rules/
        │   └── team-rules.md   # included first, before global rules
        └── commands/
            └── deploy.md       # overrides any global "deploy" command

Commands:
coding-context myteam/build
  Tasks searched:   .agents/namespaces/myteam/tasks/ then .agents/tasks/
  Rules included:   .agents/namespaces/myteam/rules/ + .agents/rules/ (both)
  Commands:         .agents/namespaces/myteam/commands/ then .agents/commands/
```

## Rule File Search Paths

Rule files are discovered from directories specified via the `-d` flag (plus automatically-added working directory and home directory). Within each directory, the CLI searches for all standard file patterns listed below.

### Directory Processing Order

1. Directories specified via `-d` flags (in order)
2. Working directory (`-C` flag or current directory) - added automatically
3. Home directory (`~`) - added automatically

### Rule File Locations Within Each Directory

**Agent-specific directories (all `.md`/`.mdc` files within these are indexed):**
```
.agents/rules/
.cursor/rules/
.augment/rules/
.windsurf/rules/
.opencode/agent/
.opencode/rules/
.github/agents/
.claude/
.codex/
.gemini/
```

**Specific files:**
```
CLAUDE.local.md
CLAUDE.md
GEMINI.md
AGENTS.md
.cursorrules
.windsurfrules
.github/copilot-instructions.md
.gemini/styleguide.md
.augment/guidelines.md
```

**Note:** All paths are searched in every search-path directory (working dir, home dir, and any `-d` directories). There is no distinction between project-level and user-level paths — the same set of sub-paths is checked in each root directory.

## Supported AI Agent Formats

The CLI automatically discovers rules from configuration files for these AI coding agents:

| Agent | Rule Locations |
|-------|----------------|
| **Anthropic Claude** | `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/` (all `.md`/`.mdc` files in directory) |
| **Codex** | `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/` (all `.md`/`.mdc` files in directory) |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursorrules` |
| **Augment** | `.augment/rules/`, `.augment/guidelines.md` |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurf/rules/`, `.windsurfrules` |
| **OpenCode.ai** | `.opencode/agent/`, `.opencode/rules/` (rules); `.opencode/command/` (commands) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/agents/` |
| **Google Gemini** | `GEMINI.md`, `.gemini/styleguide.md`, `.gemini/` (all `.md`/`.mdc` files in directory) |
| **Generic** | `.agents/rules/` (rules), `.agents/tasks/` (tasks), `.agents/commands/` (commands) |

## Discovery Behavior

### File Types

The CLI processes:
- `.md` files (Markdown)
- `.mdc` files (Markdown component)

Other file types are ignored.

### Directory Processing

The CLI searches within each directory specified in search paths. It does not traverse parent directories automatically. Each directory is searched independently for the standard file patterns listed above.

**Example:**
```
Search paths:
1. /home/user/projects/myapp/backend/ (working directory, auto-added)
2. /home/user/ (home directory, auto-added)

Searches in /home/user/projects/myapp/backend/:
- .agents/rules/
- .agents/tasks/
- CLAUDE.md
- AGENTS.md
- etc.

Searches in /home/user/:
- .agents/rules/
- .claude/CLAUDE.md
- etc.
```

### Precedence Order

When multiple rule files exist across different directories:
1. Directories specified via `-d` flags (in order)
2. Working directory
3. Home directory

Within each directory, all matching files are included (unless filtered by selectors).

## Bootstrap Script Discovery

For each rule file `rule-name.md`, the CLI looks for `rule-name-bootstrap` in the same directory.

**Example:**
```
./.agents/rules/jira-context.md
./.agents/rules/jira-context-bootstrap  ← Must be here
```

**Not searched:**
```
./.agents/rules/jira-context.md
./.agents/tasks/jira-context-bootstrap  ← Wrong directory
./jira-context-bootstrap                ← Wrong directory
```

### Bootstrap failure handling

Rule files are discovered and expanded for one rule directory before bootstrap
scripts from that directory run. Bootstrap processing completes before discovery
moves to the next rule directory, preserving search-path order.

- **Strict search paths:** A rule bootstrap failure is fatal and `Run` returns an
  error. Rules after the failing bootstrap are not published. A rule parse or
  expansion error is also fatal and `Run` returns an error before any bootstrap
  scripts from that directory run.
- **Lenient search paths:** A rule bootstrap failure logs a warning, excludes only
  the failing rule, and continues with later rules in the same directory.

A rule parse or expansion error still stops discovery of the remainder of that
directory. On a lenient path, rules discovered before that error remain eligible
for bootstrap and publication, and processing continues with the next rule
directory or search path.

## Working Directory

The `-C` option changes the working directory, which is automatically added to the search paths:

```bash
# Search from /path/to/project
coding-context -C /path/to/project fix-bug

# The working directory is automatically included, equivalent to:
coding-context -d file:///path/to/project fix-bug
```

The working directory is automatically included in search paths, so rules and tasks in that directory are discovered automatically.

## Custom Organization

You can organize rules in subdirectories:

```
.agents/
├── rules/
│   ├── planning/
│   │   ├── requirements.md
│   │   └── architecture.md
│   ├── implementation/
│   │   ├── go-standards.md
│   │   └── python-standards.md
│   └── testing/
│       └── test-requirements.md
└── tasks/
    ├── plan.md
    ├── implement.md
    └── test.md
```

All `.md` files in `.agents/rules/` and its subdirectories are discovered.

## Filtering

Regardless of where rules are found, they can be filtered using selectors:

```bash
# Include only Go rules (from any location)
coding-context -s languages=go fix-bug

# Include only planning rules
coding-context -s stage=planning plan-feature
```

## Examples

### Multi-Language Project

```
.agents/
└── rules/
    ├── general-standards.md        (no frontmatter - always included)
    ├── go-backend.md               (languages: [ go ])
    ├── python-ml.md                (languages: [ python ])
    └── javascript-frontend.md      (languages: [ javascript ])

Commands:
coding-context -s languages=go fix-bug
  → Includes: general-standards.md, go-backend.md

coding-context -s languages=python train-model
  → Includes: general-standards.md, python-ml.md

**Note:** Language values should be lowercase (e.g., `go`, `python`, `javascript`).
```

### Environment Tiers

```
.agents/rules/
├── security-base.md       (no frontmatter)
├── dev-config.md          (environment: development)
├── staging-config.md      (environment: staging)
└── prod-config.md         (environment: production)

Commands:
coding-context -s environment=production deploy
  → Includes: security-base.md, prod-config.md
```

### Team-Specific Rules

```
.agents/rules/
├── company-wide.md        (no frontmatter)
├── backend-team.md        (team: backend)
└── frontend-team.md       (team: frontend)

~/.agents/rules/
└── personal-preferences.md

Commands:
coding-context -s team=backend fix-bug
  → Includes: company-wide.md, backend-team.md, personal-preferences.md
```

## Troubleshooting

**No rules found:**
- Check that directories are in search paths (working directory and home directory are added automatically)
- Verify that `.agents/rules/` directory exists in one of the search path directories
- Verify files have `.md` or `.mdc` extension
- Check file permissions (must be readable)
- For remote directories, verify the download succeeded (check stderr logs)

**Task not found:**
- Verify that `.agents/tasks/` directory exists in one of the search path directories (working directory or home directory)
- Check that the filename (without `.md` extension) matches the task name you're using (e.g., `fix-bug.md` for `fix-bug`)
- Ensure filename has `.md` extension
- Verify the directory containing the task is in search paths (working directory and home directory are added automatically)
- Note: Tasks are matched by filename, not by `task_name` in frontmatter
- Note: Commands (in `.agents/commands/`, `.cursor/commands/`, `.opencode/command/`) are NOT tasks - they're referenced via slash commands inside task content

**Rules not filtered correctly:**
- Verify frontmatter YAML is valid
- Check selector spelling and capitalization
- Remember: only top-level frontmatter fields match
